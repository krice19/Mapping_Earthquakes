# Mapping_Earthquakes

## About the Project

This analysis uses geoJSON data, d3, and javascript to map information regarding earthquake data.  The final visualization will be a map with 3 layers: one for all earthquakes, one for plate tectonics, and one for major earthquakes with high magnitudes.  The location of the earthquakes are mapped with a circle, which differs in radius and color depending on magnitude.  The final visualization will also include 3 map styles to choose from: street, satellite street, and dark.
